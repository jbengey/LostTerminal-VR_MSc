    Hello there! Can I interest you in our specialty sandwhich Sir?

    I hope the security guard was able to help you Sir. How can I be of assistance?

Actually yes I did just see a child wearing a yellow t-shirt...
They were with a fairly odd looking man, which I can only assume was their father?

It's a bargain at just Â£3.75,
You get the choice of Ham or chicken and we even do a vegetarian option!

Oh no... there have been a few of these incidents recently...
Please try not to worry...
Head over to the security guard, he will know what to do!
