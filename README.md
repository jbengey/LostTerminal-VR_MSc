# LostTerminal-VR_MSc

This application is a demonstration of applying AI to characters in unity. The project utilises Yarn Spinner to create a storyline which is nonlinear and involves a mixture of an artificial crowd and interactable NPC’s. The simple story is where you play the parent of a lost child and must speak to staff in the airport to determine what has happened.

## Features:

### Crowd AI
Crowd has a handful of idle states, as well as the ability to navigate the terminal and avoid obstacles and players. The crowd characters also react to being pushed whilst walking - in either left, right or forward directions.

### Animated NPC Characters with dialogue
Story dialogue that centres around the users choices. Attached animations, aim constraints and sounds help to aid the storytelling.
